    <h2> Gaming Content</h2>
    <p>Gaming has woven its way into all areas of pop culture—sports, music, television, and more. Its appeal goes far beyond teenage boys (women are now the largest video game-playing demographic!). So it's no surprise that gaming content has taken off on YouTube. Why? As one gaming creator put it, "You don't have to play soccer to enjoy it on TV." From an advertiser's perspective, gaming content is a rare breed—one that delivers engagement and reach. Even if your brand isn't part of the gaming industry, you can get in on the action. Gautam Ramdurai, insights lead, pop culture and gaming at Google, explains how.  A generation (18—34-year-old millennials) has grown up on gaming. For them, having a gaming console was as ordinary as having a TV. They can probably still recall blowing into game cartridges and wondering if it made a difference. And if they grew up on gaming, they came of age in the YouTube era. Many now consider it the best platform to explore their passions. (Platforms surveyed include AOL, ComedyCentral.com, ESPN.com, Facebook, Hulu, Instagram, MTV.com, Tumblr, Vimeo, and YouTube.) This convergence has resulted in an abundance of gaming content, and brands interested in connecting with this interested and engaged audience should take note. An engaged community and culture

Just how popular is gaming? A Nielsen report shows that about two-thirds of the U.S. population (64%) plays video games on some device. And game launches can draw crowds that match even the biggest blockbuster movie audiences. Take, for instance, the highest-grossing movie of 2014 to date, Transformers: Age of Extinction. In its 15 weeks at the box office, the film took in over $1B worldwide. By comparison, the Grand Theft Auto V game launch hit that figure in the first week of release last year. It became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history and broke another five sales records along the way, according to Guinness World Records. Interest in gaming is also soaring on YouTube. In 2014, the second-most searched topic on YouTube is actually a game: Minecraft. What's more, it's not just the volume of views that is impressive. It's the level of engagement and time spent with gaming content that should make marketers do a double-take. Some of the Top YouTube Queries of 2014

Gaming content takes many forms

Gaming content on YouTube spans a wide range: game news and reviews, instructional videos, people goofing off while playing games, and, of course, competitive gaming championships. One exciting and fast-growing category on YouTube is competitive gaming, also referred to as eSports. As with pro sports (baseball and football, for example), it has iconic players, fans, team uniforms, playoffs, and more. Although the eSports phenomenon is garnering significant media attention and revenue, it's only part of a much larger gaming content ecosystem. Also popular on YouTube are walkthrough videos, which help gamers conquer their foes, find hidden gems, and improve their pace. This genre of video is called "Let's Play." It's like watching your favorite basketball star dunk while listening to rich commentary on how he does it, but for gaming. And Let's Play creators take viewers on a hilarious journey through games, allowing them to witness their failures, detours, and successful strategies. Sometimes watching someone else play a game can be as much fun as playing yourself. This isn't surprising because we engage in similar behavior when watching the Food Network. Even though we can't taste the food being prepared on shows such as Chopped, the process, tension, and competitive nature make for great entertainment. In a recent Google Consumer Survey, viewers often cited the "reactions" and "commentary" of the YouTube creator as a big draw for this kind of content. One respondent said, "It's a shared experience with a favorite creator." Conan O'Brien's Clueless Gamer series is a great example of this. He may not play games well, but his commentary, observations, and reactions add value—and a lot of laughs. Engaged viewers keep coming back for more

Gaming content on YouTube is some of the stickiest. More than 20 of the top 100 YouTube channels with the most subscribers worldwide are gaming related. Who's the most subscribed? That would be Let's Play creator PewDiePie, with over 32M subscribers. His loyal following now outnumbers the population of Canada. To give you some perspective, Google Trends shows that searches for PewDiePie on YouTube are on par with stars such as Eminem and Katy Perry. He's even made a cameo on South Park.

These huge subscriber numbers make for a sustained and loyal audience, and viewers keep coming back for more. YouTube data shows that six of the top ten most-viewed channels in the U.S. are about gaming. And on most days in October, there was at least one gaming video on the daily top ten "trending on YouTube" list.</p>
